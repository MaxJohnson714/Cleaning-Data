## Introduction 
Hello, and thank you for exploring my project. Let's begin with an overview of the data. The primary method of collection was through Google Forms. However, the dataset presented certain limitations, notably around six columns containing free-response entries, rendering them unusable. Additionally, given the self-reported nature of the data, its accuracy may be less reliable compared to other collection methods. Despite these challenges, working on this dataset proved to be an engaging and enjoyable endeavor, particularly in addressing errors and enhancing its overall quality.
